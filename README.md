# Battleship
## Introduction

The game is played by two players, each one placing "battleships" on their 10 x 10 board.

Once all the ships have been placed, the game can start.

Each Player attacks one position on each turn. They et a "hit" when an enemy ship is at that position, and a "miss" otherwise.

The first player who have "hit" all the ship positions of the other player wins the game.
